SDL-1.2 version of SDL_PSL1GHT_Libs
-----------------------------------

This is a mostly unmodified version of SDL_PSL1GHT_Libs, but with an additional
patch for porting SDL-1.2.14 to PSL1GHT v2. 

The SDL port is in some places based on cebash's SDL-1.3 port (e.g. threading
is copied verbatim) but much is written from scratch. In the files where there 
is no copyright/license, assume a 'free beer' license. (unless, of course, you 
redistribute as binary, in which case LGPL infects these files).

INSTALL
-------

As of the latest ps3toolchain, SDL-1.3 is built by defaut. The following steps
help you install this version on top of that.

1) rm -rf $PS3DEV/portlibs/ppu
	SDL-1.3 is built directly into this directory. This removes all the 
	ps3libraries too.
2) install ps3libraries
	before building, remove the two sdl-related buildscripts. Then build
	as usual
3) run ./make_SDL_Libs.sh 
	you can edit the SDL_INSTALL_PATH if you don't want to install SDL to 
	some non-default place
